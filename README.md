# SGE_Behavioral_Project

This repo contains two subdirectories. The first includes files related to the SGE behavioral projecy I am working on. It includes a google doc that will be continuously updated to track progress on the SGE behavioral project and an an RMarkdown doc with code and results for SGE behavioral project analyses. The second subdirectory includes the same two files but related to the SGE single-cell aging project.
